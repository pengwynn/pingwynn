Questions, feedback, suggestions, etc. The right spot if you:

- want to know _how GitHub does xyz?_
- have an n00b Ruby question? 
- [Octokit][] has you down and you need some HALP!
- have a favorite project you want to share?
- wonder what [.dotfiles][] are anyway.
- need/have suggestions for great singer/songwriter (alt)country artists on Rdio.
- want to know how to get started in open source.
- have (are considering) a job in development and want to know how level up.
- don't get or would like to purchase the tee shirt I'm wearing.
- have feedback on a talk I gave.

... or just want to say "howdy."
