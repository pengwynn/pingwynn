- wonder what [.dotfiles][] are anyway.
- need/have suggestions for great singer/songwriter (alt)country artists on Rdio.
- want to know how to get started in open source.
- have (are considering) a job in development and want to know how to level up.
- don't get or would like to purchase the tee shirt I'm wearing.
- have feedback on a talk I gave.

... or just want to say "howdy." Just [**open an issue**][issue].
